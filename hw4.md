## 1. Detection & Segmentation
Image detection would be very useful for video surveillance technology. Unlike image segmentation, which classifies every single pixel in the image (utilizing skip connections to maintain precision past the vaguery of the bottleneck), image detection creates bounding boxes to label entire objects. Combining this with video surveillance would be useful, as you could analyze each frame (or certain frames, such as those which have detected movement of some kind, through other means) and then point out objects on the screen, such as people, or an object that has fallen or been moved, or even a difference in background objects such that
