`hw4.md` - answers to non-code questions

`my_log.txt` - scattered outputs & observations as i was trying to get code working & fine-tune parameters

`save_model` - saved model. redownloaded a few times through commits to show some versions i went through

`submission.csv` - for kaggle

`eda_birds.ipynb` - also redownloaded a few times. see older commits for google colab import code, newer commits work on kaggle. if you use google colab maybe replace my kaggle API key with your own
